# CoordML
 Manage ML experiments with ease.
 
 CoordML is a light-weight Machine Learning experiment tool that enables users to easily define computational tasks and distribute tasks across multiple instances. It can also aggregate and display experiment results through a unifed web interface.
 
 CoordML is currently working in progress. It consists of the following major components:
 
 - *Sircle DSL*, a functional and interpreted language, used to define computational tasks in a expressive and flexible way. **(Finished)**
 - *CoordML Central*, the central server to create experiments and distribute tasks. **(Working in progress)**
 - *Runner*, to run tasks and extract results. **(Working in progress)**
 - *Web Portal*, to display runner status and experiment results and aggregate experiment results in a flexible and clear way. **(Working in progress)**
 
## Sircle DSL

![Sircle Screenshot](./screenshots/sircle_welcome.png)
 
Sircle is a powerful DSL for defining computational tasks. It is in functional styles, supporting first-class functions, ML-style application and currying.

A simple example of Sircle:
```
map (compose println $ x => "Hello, " + x) ["Sircle", "CoordML"]
```
This will print out
```
Hello, Sircle
Hello, CoordML
```

For a detailed guide to Sircle, you may refer to the [Documentation](https://coordml.github.io/sircle_dsl/introduction/).
